# Royal Game of Ur

## Overview
The Royal Game of Ur is an ancient board game with strategic gameplay involving movement of pieces across a grid of tiles. Here's a quick summary of the rules:

## Game Components
- **Board**: Consists of 20 navigable tiles arranged in a grid format.
- **Pieces**: Each player has 7 pieces.
- **Rosettes**: There are 5 rosettes on the board which grant extra turns and provide safety to pieces.

## Gameplay
- Players roll a set of dice that can yield a result between 0 and 4.
- Pieces move according to the dice roll, following the paths on the board.
- Rosettes grant extra turns and safety to pieces.
- Landing on an opponent's piece captures it, returning it to the opponent's layout.
- Players cannot stack their pieces on the same tile.
- To remove a piece from the board, a player must roll exactly the right number.
